                         I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of Belgian Waffles, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will whip up this recipe and throw it in the fridge. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill and throw that mix on, and I go back to sleep. Then I wake up to the smell of Belgian Waffles. It is delicious, it is good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Sorry if you don't watch the office and do not get the reference but I reccomend watching my favourite episode, "The Injury".
